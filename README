Welcome to some simple tools to help me handle OpenStack bugs.

All commands take a --username=<launchpad username> and --project.

fetchbugs:       updates my swift snapshot of all outstanding bugs
triage:          triage bugs based on my personal criteria
prioritize_list: take a list of priority bugs and mark them as such
report:          dump a report about what my triage found

review:          for each triaged bug, open a chromium tab with any code reviews outstanding for that bug. Yes really.
