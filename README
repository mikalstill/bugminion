Welcome to some simple tools to help me handle OpenStack bugs.

All commands take a --username=<launchpad username> and --project.

fetchbugs: updates my swift snapshot of all outstanding bugs
triage:    triage bugs based on my personal criteria
report:    dump a report about what my triage found

review:    for each triaged bug, open a chromium tab with any code reviews outstanding for that bug. Yes really.
